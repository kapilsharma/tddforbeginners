# Introduction

Writing software is not a difficult task. Anyone may learn programming languages and write functional code. This is specially true with easy to learn programming languages like PHP.

However writing production ready code, which is having a good architecture and ready to extended, both with changing requirements and scaling takes lot of experience, dedication and continuous learning. Test driven development is a crucial part of writing such code.

This is the beginners guide for `Test Driven Development` in PHP. However it also deals with all the development best practices. You will not only learn TDD approach and PHP Unit but also about basics of git, composer, PSRs, auto-loading, in short, basics of writing high quality code.

This books main intention is to make you better developer. Thus along with TDD, it will also covers basics for many other tools. Few examples of included tools are:

  - **Composer** is dependency management tool for PHP projects. Now a days, composer is the integral part of almost all PHP projects. Thus for every decent PHP developer, this is one of the most basic tools and composer basics are covered in this course.
  - **Git** is one of the most popular `source code management` or `versioning` tool. Any decent programmer must know about Git and we are going to cover git basics.
  - **PHP QA tools** ensure we are writing high quality code. Although we can not cover every QA tool, but we are going to cover quite a few and once you know them, you are definitely going to love them.
  - **Open source** is one of the most important part of developers' community. Sharing code with community also let you develop into better developer as other point out your mistakes and help you improve. If you are willing to contribute to open source, this course will help you to know where to start and how to contribute.
  - And many more. Actually each appendix is dedicated to one of the these development tools.

## Prerequisite

Since the book is intended for the beginners, we just assume you have intermediate PHP knowledge. If you are learning PHP, this book might not be a good companion for you. Please note this book do not teach PHP basics.

Still, we need many tools for proper TDD thus we are going to cover basics of these tools. `Chapter 1 - TDD Workshop` is not only a quick TDD workshop, but it also help you to go through few basics, installing required tools and understand them.

## Book approach and organized

We can not learn coding by reading. To become better developer, we must code and code a lot. Thus this book mainly concentrate on short workshops. As a coding geek, I always hate text book approach, which include lot of boring stuff. Yes I agree these boring stuff are important but at the same time I strongly believe writing some real time code is best way to learn code.

Thus this book focus on real workshop approach. Each chapter represent a workshop and in each workshop, you will code and learn something new. Obviously I try my best to not load you with lot of new stuff in single chapter/workshop. We will start with simple workshop and gradually move towards more complex requirements. All the code needed during workshop is available as open source project on GitHub, which you can easily clone. Don't worry if you don't know Git or how to clone, `Appendix A - Git basics and Github` is there to help you. In the workshop, we will be actually making that code step by step. At the start of each chapter, there is an introduction section, which give details of what you should already knowing (generally learned in previous workshop) and what new will you learn.

These chapters are actually some of the real workshops, I organized during PHP Reboot meet-ups. I included these workshops as chapters. We will actually start with `Chapter 1 - TDD Basics`, which is most basic course of test driven development approach.

Thus this book is divided into two parts; regular chapters and appendix. Regular chapters includes workshops and appendix are short course of required tools like Git, Composer, Jenkins, Travis, PHP QA Tools etc.

## Who should read this book?

This book is intended for all beginners and intermediate developers still I believe all developers will learn some something new from this book. One book can not be intended for beginners and advanced users. I prefer to keep this book targeted towards junior to intermediate developers but even if you are an advanced developer, I still believe you might learn something new from this book.

## How should I read this book?

Since this book is meant for beginners as well, our first workshop will be very simple. Obviously more advanced developers, having some experience in PHP Unit might find initial workshops are not very useful. I recommend to read every workshop in sequence as what we learn previous chapter will be used in next chapter. Still first go through introduction section which will tell you in details what you will learn with current chapter. If you think you know everything discussed in current chapter, you can easily skip the chapter and move to next chapter.

## Feedback

This is my first book and I am also not following traditional book approach. This book is based on my experience and some of the practical workshops I conducted. Thus I'm very much interested in the feedback about approach or how can I make this book better. If you have any feedback for me, please let me know at twitter @kapilsharmainfo or contact me through my website www.kapilsharma.info.

Waiting for your feedback. Happy learning...
