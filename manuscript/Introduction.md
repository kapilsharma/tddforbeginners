# Introduction

This is the beginners guide for `Test Driven Development` in PHP. However it also deals with all the development best practices. You will not only learn TDD approach and PHP Unit but also about basics of git, composer, PSRs, auto-loading.

## Prerequisite

Since the book is intended for the beginners, we just assume you have basic PHP knowledge.
